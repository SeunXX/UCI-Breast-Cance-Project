# UCI-Breast-Cancer-Project
Classify Screened Breast Cancer Benign or Malignant with Random Forest Algorithm using Built-in Python SCIKIT Learn

--> This project is inspired by Dataaspirant http://bit.ly/Dataaspirant_BreastCancer. Thank you, you made my journey into machine learning easier. 

This project deals with classifying screened breast cancer dataset obtained from UCI (http://bit.ly/2u1ONEC). I am using this dataset to build a random forest classifer using python built in function. I will attach another script covering the same project ,but using self developed functions.

This breast cancer dataset is the most popular classification dataset. Which is having 10 features and 1 target class.

Breast Cancer dataset features:

Sample code number:
id number
Clump Thickness:
The values are in the range of 1 – 10
Uniformity of Cell Size:
The values are in the range of 1 – 10
Uniformity of Cell Shape:
The values are in the range of  1 – 10
Marginal Adhesion:
The values are in the range of 1 – 10
Single Epithelial Cell Size:
The values are in the range of  1 – 10
Bare Nuclei:
The values are in the range of  1 – 10
Bland Chromatin:
The values are in the range of  1 – 10
Normal Nucleoli:
The values are in the range of  1 – 10
Mitoses:
The values are in the range of  1 – 10

Breast Cancer dataset Target:
The target has two classes

Bening
The value will be 2
Malignant
The value will be 4
